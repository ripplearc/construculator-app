/// Abstract repository interface for cost estimation data operations.

/// This repository defines the contract for accessing cost estimation data from various
/// data sources (local storage, remote APIs, etc.). It follows the repository
/// pattern to abstract data access logic from the domain layer.

/// The repository provides methods for retrieving cost estimates associated with
/// specific projects, enabling the domain layer to work with cost estimation
/// entities without being coupled to specific data source implementations.
///
/// Details can be found in the detailed design document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHn-LanxVJ96-HSe47C9Km0evtkPcyQDw9eDzFD60AA/edit?tab=t.m4ek8adycklb#heading=h.pvhts1v5ct4j
