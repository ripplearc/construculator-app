/// Failure represents specific, anticipated error conditions or alternative outcomes of an operation (e.g., a use case or repository method).
/// Unlike exceptions (which signify unexpected, disruptive events and are `thrown`),
/// `Failure` objects are `returned`, typically as the `Left` side of an `Either<Failure, SuccessType>`.
/// This pattern makes error handling explicit and part of the function's contract.
///
/// Key Difference between `Failure` (with `Either`) and `AppException`:
///    - `Failure`: Represents *expected/anticipated* alternative outcomes. Handled by checking the
///      result of a function (e.g., `result.isLeft()` or `result.fold(...)`).
///    - `AppException`: Represents *unexpected/exceptional* events that disrupt normal flow.
///      Handled using `try-catch` blocks.
