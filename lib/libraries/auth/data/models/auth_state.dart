/// Represents the current authentication state of the application.

/// This model encapsulates the authentication status and user information
/// at any given point in time. It is used throughout the authentication
/// flow to track whether a user is authenticated or unauthenticated.
/// 
/// The [AuthState] is typically managed by authentication managers and
/// notifiers to provide a centralized way to track user authentication
/// status across the application.
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final authState = AuthState(
///   status: AuthStatus.authenticated,
///   user: UserCredential(...),
/// );
/// ```
