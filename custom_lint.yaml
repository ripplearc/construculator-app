# This file is optional.
# It is ONLY used to provide rule-specific configurations, not to enable or disable rules.
# Rules are enabled/disabled in the 'analysis_options.yaml' file.

#
# EXAMPLE:
# If a rule (e.g., 'use_logger') exposed custom options, you would configure them here.
# The code for the 'use_logger' lint would then read these values.
